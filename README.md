## Why an AI Chatbot Instead of Traditional Form-Based Tools?
DAPA leverages an AI chatbot over traditional form-based tools for the following reasons:

1. **Localized Language Support**:
   - Users can narrate their experiences in their own local language, including dialects, through platforms like WhatsApp. The AI chatbot interprets, summarizes, and processes this information seamlessly.

2. **Ease of Use**:
   - Unlike rigid forms, a conversational AI provides a more intuitive, human-like interface, enabling users to express their ordeal naturally without worrying about form structure or specific formats.

3. **Advanced Understanding**:
   - The AI model not only captures and categorizes scam details but also creates concise summaries, ensuring that valuable information is accurately stored in a centralized database for combating scams.

4. **Centralized Scam Pattern Analysis**:
   - The summaries generated by the chatbot help uncover common scam patterns. By analyzing these trends, DAPA contributes to developing preventive measures and combating scams more effectively at scale.

5. **Accessibility**:
   - By integrating with popular platforms like WhatsApp, the AI chatbot increases accessibility, making it easier for users in remote or underserved areas to report scams.

6. **Insights**:
